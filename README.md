# EAYALA_Thesis
Code of the ML models created for the thesis "Scalability of Neural Network Models for the Classification and Detection of Threats in Network Traffic"

1.- You have to use Jupyter Notebook or similar tools to apoen the files.
2.- The files are divided into two categories Cloud code and On premise-code
3.- Is necesary to install all the dependencies, libraries, and TensorFlow framework
4.- Is necesary to have a dedicated GPU to test the strategies in TensorFlow, otherwhise the best configuration is using the CPU
